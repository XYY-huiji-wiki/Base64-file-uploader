# MIUI Themes Collector User Guide

Welcome to the [MIUI Themes Collector](#miui-themes)! This guide will help you understand how to use this tool, designed to create a data page, a theme page, upload theme images to XYY huijiwiki, and back up the original theme file to GitHub with only a link and a few clicks. Just pop the kettle on, and let’s begin!

> [!NOTE] NOTE
> This tool is for MIUI themes only, not for HyperOS themes, though they both belong to Xiaomi.

4. Submit the theme to GitHub and other platforms, then cross your fingers for good luck!
