# Special Files

Due to the limitations of the Huijiwiki file system, only a few formats of files can be uploaded to the XYY Wiki. For the sake of archiving the original files, you can upload files of other formats on the [Upload Special Files](#/file-uploader) page. Files uploaded through this special method are referred to as "special files" below.

## File Upload

- The size of a single file cannot exceed 10MB (actually requires 44 bytes less than 10MB).
- It's highly recommended to add source information of files when uploading. If the source of the files are not the same, you need to upload them one by one and fill in the source information one by one.
- If the file format you want to upload is one of png, jpg, jpeg, gif, webp, ogg, please [click here to upload](/wiki/特殊:上传文件).

## File Manager

- The search box above can be used to search for file names.
- Right-click on the file in the list to delete, rename, download, etc.
